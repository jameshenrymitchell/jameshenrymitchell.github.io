    "desc": "With a simple swab test, Living DNA illustrates not only your regional ancestry results, but how all we are all related at some point in time. While founded on a noble premise, the product was shrouded in intimidating, scientific jargon. Together with the wider Product team, our first challenge was to liberate the experience of opaque terminology and make test results simple to&nbsp;understand.",

The DNA Profiles module quickly summarises information in a tabular format, and provides tools to update a wealth of information and preferences, relating specifically to a&nbsp;profile."

Having crafted and tested a new suite of nomenclature to narrate the results, we set about to improve the storytelling. The experience is divided into purchasable units, that a user can unlock via an express checkout. Working with a third-party map service, we were able to achieve dual-synchronicity between peripheral UI controls and the map itself. In this case, the technology allowed for a cleaner, digestible, and fully navigable mobile&nbsp;experience."

In the product development process, we distilled our prospective user base into three varied personas, used to model much of our design&nbsp;decisions."
